# Dashtoon Assignment
## Overview
Dashtoon Assignment is a web application that utilizes neural style transfer to transform ordinary images into artistic masterpieces. This project is implemented in Python, leveraging Jupyter Notebook for demonstration, Streamlit for web application functionality, and PyTorch for the neural network model.

## Features
<b>Style Transfer:</b>  Apply artistic styles to images using neural style transfer techniques. \
<b>Web Application:</b> Access the style transfer functionality through a user-friendly web interface powered by streamlit. \
<b>Demonstration Notebook:</b> Explore and understand the style transfer process with the provided Jupyter Notebook.
## Repository Contents
- <b>app.py:</b> Main script for running the streamlit-based web application. 
- <b>model.py:</b> Script defining the neural network model for style transfer using PyTorch.
- <b>transfering-style.ipynb:</b> Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the style transfer process with sample images.
- <b>requirements.txt:</b> List of required Python packages for the project.

## Getting Started
- Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the web application using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
- Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501

## Demonstration
Explore the style transfer process and experiment with different images by following the steps outlined in the transfering-style.ipynb notebook. \
